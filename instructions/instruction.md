# 1. Project Setup

## Create a New Git Repository

Initialize a fresh Git repository on your local machine (e.g., `git init langgraph-project`), or create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab and then clone it locally.

Within the repository, create a clear folder structure that matches the sections described in the tutorial. For example:

```
langgraph-project/
├─ chains/
├─ graphs/
├─ utils/
├─ example_emails.py
├─ pyproject.toml  # Using Poetry
├─ .env            # For environment variables
└─ README.md
```

## Virtual Environment with Poetry:

1.  **Install Poetry** if not already installed:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

2.  **Set up and activate Poetry environment**:
    ```bash
    poetry init # Follow prompts to create pyproject.toml
    poetry shell
    ```

## Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`):

Ensure your `pyproject.toml` includes these dependencies under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9" # Or your desired Python version
langgraph = "^0.0.10" # Check for latest versions
langchain-openai = "^0.1.0"
pydantic = {extras = ["email"], version = "^2.7.0"}
python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Environment Variables:

1.  Create a blank `.env` file at the root of the project.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key in this file:
    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    ```
3.  In your Python code, load the key using `python-dotenv`:
    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()
    # Optional: Directly get key if needed, many libraries auto-detect
    # OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    ```

4.  **Document** this `.env` setup requirement in the `README.md` file.

# 2. Add Core Tutorial Files

Below is a suggested breakdown of how to organize and commit each file described in the article. Each bullet point references the sections in the article.

### `example_emails.py`

*   Create the file at the root of your project (`langgraph-project/example_emails.py`).
*   Copy in the example emails array exactly as shown in the article.
*   Commit changes:
    ```bash
    git add example_emails.py
    git commit -m "Add example emails for testing"
    ```

### Chains (folder: `chains/`)

*   **`notice_extraction.py`**
    *   Contains the `NOTICE_PARSER_CHAIN` and Pydantic model (`NoticeEmailExtract`) for extracting fields from regulatory emails.
    *   Include the relevant import statements and the chain definition code from the tutorial.
*   **`escalation_check.py`**
    *   Contains the `ESCALATION_CHECK_CHAIN` and the `EscalationCheck` Pydantic model.
*   **`binary_questions.py`**
    *   Contains the `BINARY_QUESTION_CHAIN` and `BinaryAnswer` model for answering yes/no questions.
*   Make sure each chain file is thoroughly documented in its docstrings or in a top-level comment so it's easy to see what they do.
*   Commit changes:
    ```bash
    git add chains/*.py
    git commit -m "Add chain files for notice extraction, escalation checks, and binary questions"
    ```

### Utilities (folder: `utils/`)

*   `logging_config.py`: Contains the logging configuration and the global `LOGGER`.
*   `graph_utils.py`: Contains helper functions (`send_escalation_email`, `create_legal_ticket`) that the state graphs call.
*   Commit these:
    ```bash
    git add utils/*.py
    git commit -m "Add logging config and utility functions for graph nodes"
    ```

# 3. Build the First State Graph

## `graphs/notice_extraction.py`

*   Create a `graphs/` folder.
*   Define the `GraphState` typed dictionary to store the fields (`notice_message`, `notice_email_extract`, etc.).
*   Create node functions for:
    *   `parse_notice_message_node`
    *   `check_escalation_status_node`
    *   `send_escalation_email_node`
    *   `create_legal_ticket_node`
    *   `answer_follow_up_question_node`
*   Add edges with `workflow.add_edge(...)` and `workflow.add_conditional_edges(...)`.
*   Compile the final workflow into `NOTICE_EXTRACTION_GRAPH`.
*   Commit changes:
    ```bash
    git add graphs/notice_extraction.py
    git commit -m "Implement the main notice extraction graph with conditional edges and cycles"
    ```

## Test the Graph

*   Run a Python REPL or a script that imports `NOTICE_EXTRACTION_GRAPH` and passes various `initial_state` values from your `example_emails.py`.
*   Confirm the outputs align with the tutorial's results.

# 4. Develop the Agent

## `graphs/email_agent.py`

*   Import `MessagesState` from `langgraph.graph` to store LLM messages.
*   Create a `ToolNode` and define multiple `@tool`-decorated functions:
    *   `forward_email(email_message, send_to_email)`
    *   `send_wrong_email_notification_to_sender(sender_email, correct_department)`
    *   `extract_notice_data(email, escalation_criteria)` – calls the `NOTICE_EXTRACTION_GRAPH`.
    *   `determine_email_action(email)` – a fallback tool for deciding which action an email needs.
*   Create the agent node:
    *   Use `EMAIL_AGENT_MODEL` bound to the four tools above.
    *   Define a `call_agent_model_node` function to handle LLM calls.
*   Add edges to form a cycle between the agent node and the tool node until there are no more tool calls.
*   Commit changes:
    ```bash
    git add graphs/email_agent.py
    git commit -m "Create and integrate an email agent graph with tool usage"
    ```

## Test the Agent

*   Again, open a Python REPL (or create a test script) and feed the agent each of the example emails, verifying that the agent:
    *   Correctly calls the notice extraction graph for regulatory notices.
    *   Routes invoices to the billing department.
    *   Routes customer requests to customer support.
    *   Sends "wrong address" notifications to the sender.

# 5. Documentation & README

## `README.md`

*   Provide a clear overview of the project's goals and how to set it up:
    *   **Project Description:** Short overview of LangGraph and how the project demonstrates building stateful, cyclic LLM workflows.
    *   **Installation:** Steps to set up the virtual environment (using Poetry), install the requirements (`poetry install`), and configure environment variables (`.env` file).
    *   **Folder Structure:** Outline of `chains/`, `graphs/`, `utils/`, and their purposes.
    *   **Usage Instructions:**
        *   Demonstrate how to run or invoke the `NOTICE_EXTRACTION_GRAPH`.
        *   Demonstrate how to run or invoke the `email_agent_graph`.
        *   Provide example commands or code snippets.
    *   **Testing:** Show how to run short scripts or open a Python REPL (`poetry run python ...` or activate shell first) to test.
*   Commit changes:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions"
    ```

## Docstrings & Inline Explanations

*   Ensure that each function, class, or node includes a docstring or comment describing its logic and intended usage.
*   If there are any intricacies (e.g., random follow-up questions in `create_legal_ticket()`), explain them clearly in either the docstrings or the README.

# 6. Push to Remote Repository

## Initialize Remote (If Not Done Already)

*   If the repository is new, create a remote on GitHub/GitLab:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <REMOTE-URL>
    ```

## Push Commits

*   Push all local commits:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main # Or your default branch name
    ```
*   Verify on your remote repository that the files and folder structure are correct.

## Open a Pull Request or Direct Access

*   If you're using a Git-based workflow with pull requests, open a PR for your senior engineer to review.
*   Otherwise, provide the senior engineer with the repository link or direct access to the main branch.

# 7. Post-Deployment Steps & Validation

## Check Logs

*   Ensure that the logs from `logging_config.py` are printing clearly and concisely.
*   Adjust logging levels if needed.

## Validate Agent Behavior

*   Test additional real-world examples, not just the four from `example_emails.py`.
*   Confirm that cycles and conditional edges work for more diverse email formats.

## Performance Considerations

*   If your senior engineer or team has specific performance constraints, consider caching LLM responses or restricting expensive calls.

## Ongoing Maintenance

*   Add new node functions or tools as needed (for example, a tool to check scheduling or handle PDF attachments).
*   Update the `README.md` and `pyproject.toml` for any new dependencies or environment variables.

# 8. Next Steps and Enhancements

After the senior engineer reviews, you and your colleague might consider:

*   **Additional Tools:** For example, building a tool that integrates with Slack or Microsoft Teams for internal notifications.
*   **Advanced Validation:** Incorporate more advanced Pydantic models and strict validations for edge cases in email content.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** Use different LLM providers or fine-tuned models if certain domain knowledge is needed.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Add mechanisms to track how often the system escalates tickets or how frequently it must answer follow-up questions.

# Summary

By following these steps, your colleague will have a fully functioning LangGraph-based project with:

*   Clear, modular code organized into logical directories.
*   Chain-based logic for smaller tasks like notice extraction, binary question answering, and escalation checks.
*   A robust state graph that demonstrates conditional edges and cycles (necessary for handling dynamic follow-up questions).
*   A flexible agent that can autonomously decide whether to call the notice extraction graph or forward an email to relevant teams.
